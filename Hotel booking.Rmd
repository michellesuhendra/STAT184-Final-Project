#path <- file.path("~", "Absenteeism_at_work_AAA", "Absenteeism_at_work.csv")
Absent <- read.csv(file = "Absenteeism_at_work_AAA/Absenteeism_at_work.csv", sep = ";")
HotelBookings <- read.csv(file = "hotel_bookings.csv")
  
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
